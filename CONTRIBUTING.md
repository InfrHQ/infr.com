## Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please ensure you have read and understood this document before contributing.

## Reporting Issues

Found a problem? Have an enhancement request? Start by checking our [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/infr/infr.com/issues) to see if a similar issue has already been opened. If one doesn't exist, feel free to [open a new issue](https://github.com/infr/infr.com/issues/new) with a detailed explanation.

## Development Workflow

Here's how to setup the development environment:

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your forked repository (not our original one) to your local machine.
3. Navigate to your local repository.
4. Set up a remote to sync changes from the original repository.

After setting up:

1. Navigate to your local repository and ensure you're on the main branch.
2. Sync your copy of the repository with the original one.
3. Create a new branch for your changes.
4. Make your changes and commit them with a meaningful commit message.
5. Push your changes to your forked repository.
6. Open a pull request in the original repository.

## Testing

Please ensure that all tests pass before submitting a pull request.

## Pull Requests

Your pull requests should:

-   Clearly describe the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
-   Be based on the main branch. If your pull request addresses a 'feature' or 'next' branch or another pull request, you should specify that.

Your pull request will be reviewed by at least one maintainer. It might be merged right away or might require some changes before it's ready to be merged.

## Thank you

We're grateful for your contribution and we're looking forward to building the future of personal data management together!
